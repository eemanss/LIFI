# LIFI
Light Fidelity is based on data transmission of data bits using very short pulses of light. These irregularities are not noticeable to the naked eye. But is easily picked up by the sensor. It would appear as though the light hasn't changed.
This Project is my final year College project and a simple representation of this technology.
At the transmitter, it only consists of LEDs driven by the microprocessor. Every keystroke on the keyboard is mapped to a certain number of pulses and the function of the receiver is merely to count this number of pulses.
At the receiver, there lies a microprocessor attached to a Light Detector such as an LDR (Light Detecting Resistor) or a Solar Panel. The microprocessor decodes this number of pulses to the key pressed at the input transmitter and the result is shown on a 16x2 LCD Display.



# ARDUINO MODEL
The project is based on the arduino development board.
Any one of the arduino uno, nano, mini, etc can be used.
I personally used arduino nano since it is very small in size and very cheap as well.
The basic circuit should first be developed on a breadboard and its working should be verified before finally moving to the complete dot PCB model.
