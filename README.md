# LIFI
transferring data bit by bit using Light Fidelity
Light Fidelity is based on data transmission of data bits using very short pulses of light. These irregularities are not noticeable to the naked eye. But is easily picked up by the sensor. It would appear as though the light hasn't changed. This Project is my final year College project and a simple representation of this technology. At the transmitter, it only consists of LEDs driven by the microprocessor. Every keystroke on the keyboard is mapped to a certain number of pulses and the function of the receiver is merely to count this number. At the receiver, there lies a microprocessor attached to a Light Detector such as an LDR (Light Detecting Resistor) or a Solar Panel. The micropocessor decodes this number to the key pressed at the input and the result is shown to a 16x2 LCD Display
